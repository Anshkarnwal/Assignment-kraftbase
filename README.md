# Next.js Project

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with **create-next-app**.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Editing Pages

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page will automatically update as you edit the file.

## API Routes

API routes can be accessed on `http://localhost:3000/api/hello`. This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

## Fonts

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load **Geist**, a new font family from Vercel.
